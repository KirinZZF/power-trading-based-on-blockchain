   abstract = {With technology progressing and the decreasing cost of renewable energy, consumers require energy supply to be smarter, cleaner, and more sustainable than before. By providing a decentralized trading mechanism, blockchain technology can facilitate sustainable energy consumption and achieve a circular economy. This study analyzes how China can employ blockchain technology to reform its energy sector. We survey the progress of blockchain technology in the energy sector and explore typical cases of energy blockchains in the world. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of applying blockchain to China's energy sector. China's monopoly market structure in energy supply impedes the application of blockchain technology, but the expansion of clean energy provides a huge opportunity for it. Although China's technological level is lagging, the biggest obstacle is not technology but rather policy. We conclude that China should loosen its regulatory environment, amend the relevant laws, and balance the conflict between management and innovation.},

This research study demonstrates the simulation of blockchain based power trading, supplemented by the solar power prediction using MLFF neural network training in two prosumer nodes. This study can be the initial step in the implementation of a power trading market model based on a decentralized blockchain system, with distributed generations in a university grid system. This system can balance the electricity demand and supply within the institute, enable secure and rapid transactions, and the local market system can be reinforced by forecasting solar generation. The performance of the MLFF training can predict almost 90% accuracy of the model as short term ahead forecasting. Because of it, the prosumer bodies can complete the decision making before trading to their benefit.},

   abstract = {Emissions trading is a cost-effective climate policy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It could also be useful for addressing road transport emissions, especially given that this sector is the largest CO2 emitter in the transportation sector and its emissions continue to increase. However, emissions trading for road transport (ETS-RT) has rarely been implemented due to its complexity. This paper designs a novel and practical policy framework for an ETS-RT based on advanced blockchain technology, including all related entities upstream, midstream and downstream of the road transport sector. First, the government determines the cap and allocates the initial permits. Then, fuel producers, vehicle manufacturers, and vehicle users are involved as regulated entities with tradable emission permits. They are responsible for the three determinants of CO2 emissions in the road transport sector: fuel emission factors, vehicle fuel economy, and vehicle miles travelled, respectively. With all the regulated entities collaborating on compliance, the three determinants can be synergistically optimized so that the efficiency of the emissions abatement can be maximized. In addition, all trading, monitoring, reporting, and verification of the emission permits are automatically executed and recorded via a smart contract deployed on a decentralized blockchain. This approach can dramatically reduce administrative costs, improve transparency and traceability, and eliminate double counting and fraud. Finally, the proposed policy was evaluated using a multicriteria analysis method compared with other possible ETS-RT approaches. Key policy insights Fuel producers, vehicle manufacturers, and vehicle users–who are respectively responsible for fuel emission factors, vehicle fuel economy and vehicle miles travelled–should be synergistically regulated in an ETS-RT to maximize the efficiency of emissions abatement. This can be enabled by advanced blockchain technology, which can eliminate the need for a central authority, while enhancing transparency, traceability and cost-effectiveness. Blockchain technology could also be useful for monitoring, reporting and verification under the Paris Agreement. A blockchain-based ETS-RT is found to outperform other forms of ETS on criteria of acceptability, feasibility and environmental performance.},

And we also observe that the carbon premium has a steady upward trend after 2014. In addition, our study proves that the coefficient of carbon risk factor is significantly positive, which can be explained by the fact that companies participating in the carbon market have higher carbon exposures.},

One resulting trend is the energy market gradually shifting toward a distributed market, where renewable energy can be traded, partly evidenced by the number of blockchain-based solutions designed for the (distributed) energy sector. The interest in blockchain is also due to blockchain’s underpinning characteristics such as anonymity, decentralized, and transparency. Therefore, in this article, we perform a comprehensive review of how blockchain technology has been, and can be, deployed in energy applications, ranging from energy management to peer-to-peer trading to electric vehicle-related applications to carbon emissions trading, and others.

This paper presents a distributed demand side management system among multiple homes in community microgrid, with the integration of the internet of things smart meter and in the presence of renewable energy sources. The proposed energy consumption game is formulated for minimizing the cost of electricity in the individual home and the total cost of energy consumption in the whole community. The smart home users are playing game by optimizing their own daily energy consumption of appliances. The multiple participants include the self renewable generation of users, shared community microgrid and optional utility company. Each participant applies its best strategy to minimize energy consumption cost and users can maintain their own privacy of energy consumption. Moreover, the proposed scheme is distributed on blockchain, which provides a trusted communication medium between the participants. It enforces the autonomous monitoring of smart appliances and the billing of electricity consumption via smart contracts. Solidity smart contract is deployed to facilitate the execution of transactions without the involvement of third party in the smart community. Comparison of the results show that the proposed approach minimizes the total cost of energy consumption as well as each user's energy consumption cost.},

   abstract = {China has implemented its carbon emission trading system (ETS) in seven pilots since 2013. Many methods have been used to evaluate the effect and efficiency of the ETS in reducing carbon emissions. Evaluating the carbon ETS to determine whether it has co-benefited the economy and environment in the seven pilots is crucial for the development of China. Moreover, different methods of measurement reveal different results on how efficient the seven carbon emission trading markets (ETMs) are. We use the difference-in-differences (DID) method to evaluate the impact of carbon emissions and economic growth following ETS implementation. Based on the data of industrial carbon emissions in 30 provinces of China from 2008 to 2016, the impact of ETS on the carbon emission reduction and economic growth of enterprises is empirically tested. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) evaluates the operating efficiency of the carbon ETMs. Based on the seven carbon emission trading pilots conducted in China in 2014–2016, the carbon ETMs differentiation system in the pilot area is taken as the input index and the ETS implementation effect is used as the output index to construct the full DEA evaluation model for gauging the operation efficiency of the carbon ETMs. The results show that the implementation of the carbon trading policy increases the economic dividend (13.6%) generated by the gross industrial output value, but significantly reduces the emission (24.2%) of industrial CO2 in all seven carbon emission trading pilots. The average DEA efficiency of the seven carbon ETMs operations in China have increased annually.},

Multi-criteria analysis is used to evaluate the proposed scheme against conventional ETS model.

   abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading allows prosumers to trade energy directly without intermediaries. To provide a payment system and record transaction information, public blockchain is designed to match the decentralized feature of the P2P market. The incentive for nodes outside the microgrid is removed but it is maintained for the prosumers within the microgrid. Therefore the number of miner competitors is limited to decrease the mining difficulty and its power consumption. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus protocol defines the function of blockchain with its mining mechanism. Miners sacrifice part of their stake to compensate for the power losses and reduce the price gap from the traditional prosumer-to-grid trading (Feed-in-tariff). Moreover, the proposed model also contributes to increase the social welfare by improving producers’ income and consumers’ cost-saving through the designed pricing scheme, which eliminates the price gap between buying and selling. Successful mining is encouraged by rewards accordingly. A case study is introduced where a microgrid model with 27 prosumers is tested with the PoS public blockchain-based pricing scheme. The process of model implementation and smart contract creation are specifically demonstrated. Numerical results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

PoB is implemented by executing the smart contracts on the Ethereum platform, and the process of achieving the maximal benefits is completed by submitting the transaction in the decentralized network. Security analysis shows that the P2PEBT system is able to manage a potential protection against up to a number of attacks.

The results under the ETreg scenario predict a carbon price of 164.64 USD/tCO2 and a total carbon trade volume of 189.91 Mt by 2030. The metal smelting sector will be the largest seller of emissions quotas in Shanghai, whereas the power generation sector will be the largest buyer.

Since the amount of EV is rising shapely, the EV charging demands is also rapidly generated. However, seeking suitable charging facilities is not easy for EV users, new energy companies run charging station separately for self-interests, and charging pile information is not transparent for drivers. This dilemma is not solved until the merging of blockchain technology. In this paper, a novel EV charging system is proposed for the cooperation of new energy companies and providing convenient charging services for users. In this system, charging information is managed and recorded by the company alliance based on consortium blockchain, which is tamper-resistant and multi-centralized. Meanwhile, a new smart contract is designed to balance the allocation of company’ charging users, so that the profits of different new energy companies could be fairer. To equilibrate the interest of companies and EV users, a Bio-Objective Mixed-Integer Programming model (BOMILP) is proposed as the mathematical logic of smart contracts. Furthermore, we proposed a new algorithm named Limited Neighborhood Search with Memory (LNSM) to support the implementation of smart contracts, which could make the smart contract running faster and has a better performance. At last, the proposed EV charging system and the smart contract are validated through a real case study with the EV charging data in Beijing, China.},

However, the on-demand use of energy is considered a big challenge to achieve the optimal cost for households. This paper proposes a blockchain-based predictive energy trading platform to provide real-time support, day-ahead controlling, and generation scheduling of distributed energy resources. The proposed blockchain-based platform consists of two modules; blockchain-based energy trading and smart contract enabled predictive analytics modules. The blockchain module allows peers with real-time energy consumption monitoring, easy energy trading control, reward model, and unchangeable energy trading transaction logs. The smart contract enabled predictive analytics module aims to build a prediction model based on historical energy consumption data to predict short-term energy consumption. This paper uses real energy consumption data acquired from the Jeju province energy department, the Republic of Korea. This study aims to achieve optimal power flow and energy crowdsourcing, supporting energy trading among the consumer and prosumer. Energy trading is based on day-ahead, real-time control, and scheduling of distributed energy resources to meet the smart grid's load demand. Moreover, we use data mining techniques to perform time-series analysis to extract and analyze underlying patterns from the historical energy consumption data. The time-series analysis supports energy management to devise better future decisions to plan and manage energy resources effectively. To evaluate the proposed predictive model's performance, we have used several statistical measures, such as mean square error and root mean square error on various machine learning models, namely recurrent neural networks and alike. Moreover, we also evaluate the blockchain platform's effectiveness through hyperledger calliper in terms of latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Based on the experimental results, the proposed model is effectively used for energy crowdsourcing between the prosumer and consumer to attain service quality.},

   abstract = {With rapid growth in global demand for energy, the emission of CO2 is increasing due to the use of fossil fuels in power plants. Effective strategies are required to decrease the industrial emissions to meet the climate change target set at 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21). Carbon capture and storage have been recognized as the most useful methods to reduce the CO2 emissions while using fossil fuels in power generation. This work reviews different methods and updates of the current technologies to capture and separate CO2 generated in a thermal power plant. Carbon capture is classified in two broad categories depending on the requirement of separation of CO2 from the gases. The novel methods of oxy combustion and chemical looping combustion carbon capture have been compared with the traditional post combustion and precombustion carbon capture methods. The current state of technology and limitation of each of the processes including commonly used separation techniques for CO2 from the gas mixture are discussed in this review. Further research and investigations are suggested based on the technological maturity, economic viability, and lack of proper knowledge of the combustion system for further improvement of the capture system.},

China has embarked on one of the largest endeavours in climate economics ever, to establish a national carbon emission trading system by 2015. As a first step, carbon-trading pilots have been initiated in seven provinces and cities. The success or failure of those experiments will to a large extent determine the future of climate policies in China. This report evaluates the progress so far and examines the key challenges ahead. While the attempts to develop a domestic carbon trading are sincere and ambitious, there are considerable difficulties. Many of the challenges are not particular to China, but common to any emission trading system. But there are also more profound worries about how to operate a market-based instrument given the current shortcomings of the Chinese market system in general. },

Consequently, the application of appropriate actions to conserve energy and reduce emissions features centrally in China's core national development goals and development policies. These goals not only pose significant challenges and opportunities, but they also entail an important innovation. Under the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, the carbon trading market has emerged at a historic moment as an important measure for conserving energy and reducing emissions. Given the continuous development of the international carbon trading market over the last decade, China is also attempting to develop its own carbon trading market to further contribute to energy conservation and emissions reduction. Based on an analysis of the current situation of China's carbon trading market, relevant policy suggestions are offered here for its improvement, with the aim of providing guidelines for reducing carbon emissions, which are of mounting concern.}

The result showed that the market efficiency of ETS pilots is not satisfactory in spite of the fact that system designs of ETS have achieved preliminary result. Then, the reason for low market efficiency of ETS pilots was discussed from some factors such as institutional arrangements, market participants, the supply and demand, etc. Finally, this paper puts forward some policy suggestions to improve the market efficiency of China׳s carbon trading market.}

In order to achieve these goals, the unified carbon emission trading system should be put into effect by 2017, the implementation of the unified carbon emission trading system depends on the effectiveness of the current carbon trading market in China. On the basis of the effective market theory and fair game model, the unit root test and the run test are developed to analyze the carbon emission market of four representative cities in China. The results show that (1) the carbon trading market in China has only achieved weak efficiency, while the semi strong efficiency and the strong efficiency have not been reached; (2) with the expansion of the market scale, the increase of trading volume, the carbon trading market would converge from the state of inefficiency to weak form efficiency gradually, and the carbon trading market in China shows signs of restoring market efficiency.}

As a result, there is an urgent need to accelerate efforts to reduce GHG emissions. In industry, the majority of the current methods of reducing GHG emissions depend on technical enhancements of the facility and equipment. These methods focus on local optimization for carbon emission reduction in enterprises and may require additional time, money and effort for satisfactory implementation. Unlike technical approaches that focus on the equipment, this paper proposes an approach that combines carbon footprint analysis and production planning. The carbon footprint of the entire company’s operational process can be analyzed systematically using this approach. Subsequently, carbon emissions can be reduced significantly through production planning and optimization. To test the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a pharmaceutical enterprise is employed as an example. A production planning model is constructed based on the energy consumption analysis of different units and equipment. Using this model, the carbon emissions of the enterprise can be analyzed, and the corresponding production plan can be developed. To determine the optimal solution, a hybrid discrete particle swarm algorithm is developed and tested based on real data collected from the pharmaceutical enterprise. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed novel approach is effective and carbon emissions of the enterprise can be reduced by an average of 6.77%, or a reduction in CO2 emissions of 610.2 tons per year.}

These governmental policies force manufacturing enterprises to emit less carbon during production and develop more energy-saving products. To examine how carbon taxes and energy-saving products subsidies affect enterprises' operational decisions, this study considers a manufacturer–retailer channel in which the manufacturer has the options to design a product to emit less carbon during production and use less energy when the product is consumed by customers. It is showed that governments’ energy-saving products subsidies stimulate reduction of carbon emissions and energy consumption, but this is not always true for carbon taxes, government should levy carbon taxes against manufacturers according to their pollution levels. Both carbon tax and subsidy policies can promote energy conservation and emission reduction if the initial carbon emission level of a manufacturer is low, but they have different promotional effects. Finally, in order to ensure the supply chain members cooperate and realise larger energy savings and emissions reductions, we propose a carbon-cost-sharing contract.}

This paper re-analyzes the differences between the carbon tax and carbon trading by applying a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model, called the CEEEA (China Environmental-Energy-Economy Analysis) model. Unlike previous literature, we make the gross domestic product an exogenous variable and explore different effects between carbon tax mechanism and carbon trading mechanism on the environment, energy, and economy. Given a constant GDP effect, both carbon trading and carbon tax have strong emission reduction capacity, but the relative emission reduction efficiency of the carbon tax is higher than that of carbon trading. This advantage increases over time. Carbon trading has a certain negative effect on the output of the energy industry, and also on the output of other energy-intensive industries involving in carbon trading. After considering the various invisible costs of establishing a new carbon trading market, this paper recommends that China could directly levy a carbon tax on energy enterprises, or just increase the production tax on fossil fuels to reduce CO2 emissions effectively. In this way, the commodity market can be used for price incentives and thus, achieve the goal of emission reduction.}

@report{Ammous2016,
   abstract = {This paper explains the functioning of "blockchain technology" and critically assesses its potential role in improving services in banking, contracts, and database systems. Comparing blockchain to the current best practice technology in these fields reveals several barriers to successful commercial implementation: Blockchain technology involves costly redundancies and irreversibility, faces serious scaling problems and significant barriers to complying with regulations, and is a security liability unless secured with its own freely trading currency. A survey of the state of the blockchain industry shows that in eight years since blockchain technology was invented, it has had no commercial applications other than digital cash. The paper concludes that a blockchain is a peculiar engineering design whose only advantage is in removing third party intermediation to allow for the creation of digital cash, and is unlikely to offer economic advantages for any commercial problem other than the one it was specifically engineered to solve. I. What is blockchain technology? Blockchain technology is originally the name given to the design underpinning the operation of the digital currency Bitcoin. Bitcoin's creator never used the term "blockchain" in his whitepaper, and reading the paper one gets the distinct impression that the author was not introducing a new technology in the traditional sense of the term, but a software design drawing on several existing technologies to allow him to create a "purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash". The essence of Bitcoin's blockchain's operation is that whenever two network members transact, they announce their transaction to all network members (nodes), who record the transaction into a block with a limited capacity. Once the block is full, nodes simultaneously perform Proof-of-Work-mathematical operations that are hard to solve but whose correct solution is easy to verify. These mathematical operations are unrelated to the bitcoin transactions, but are indispensable to the operation of the system, as they force the verifying nodes to expend processing power which would be wasted if they included any fraudulent or invalid transactions. The first node that succeeds in solving a Proof-of-Work problem broadcasts the solution, along with the block of transactions, to all other nodes. Nodes can quickly and cheaply verify the accuracy of the transactions and solutions, and when 51% of the processing power of the network votes to approve a block, nodes begin recording new transactions to a new block, amended to all previous blocks. The first node that solves the Proof-of-Work problem is rewarded with a specific quantity of the currency of the network. This reward makes verifying transactions potentially profitable, and leads to it being commonly referred to as 'mining', though 'verifying' is arguably a more functionally accurate description.},

However, issues with the flexibility and safety of this integration still remain. In addition, further improvements in power generation were identified from the use of high-grade LNG cold energy in LAES. Thus, this paper proposes a novel and advanced integration (denoted as LNG-LAES) for enhancements in flexibility, safety, and power generation. LNG is re-gasified in two different manners: it flows into a parallel two-stage regenerative Rankine cycle for conventional power generation during peak times or transfers high-grade cold energy to LAES for energy storage during off-peak times. Pressures of LNG vaporization and liquid air storage are minimized to 7 and 0.15 MPa to achieve an inherently safer design. The process assessment is performed considering possible demand and marketing scenarios, in which the LNG-LAES process exhibits the best performance in terms of power generation and economic benefits. In the base-case, the specific daily net power output increases up to 94.8 kJ/kgLNG and the electrical round trip efficiency of LAES achieves 129.2%. Moreover, the LNG-LAES process has design flexibility that the amount of LNG cold energy utilized in LAES can be varied at the design stage to maximize the operating profit corresponding to a specific electricity market scenario. The analyzes demonstrate that the proposed LNG-LAES process is both technically feasible and economically preferable for industrial applications.}

It is widely accepted that blockchain technology causes disruptive changes in supply chain operations that can overcome supply chain difficulties encountered in realizing information sharing, maintaining traceability in the entire process and improving operational efficiency. However, the application of blockchain technology in the supply chain field is still in its infancy, which limits an understanding of its potential. This article uses descriptive and content analysis to review publications related to blockchain-based supply chains between 2017 and 2020 inclusive. To fully explore research on blockchain-based supply chains, four well-designed questions are proposed and addressed, namely, the value of blockchain in supply chains, the attraction of scholars to particular supply chain themes, the development of research methodologies and illustration types in adopting blockchain in supply chains, and the types of industries involved in blockchain-based supply chains. The results reveal that there is growing interest in applying blockchain technology to supply chain operations. A detailed analysis of findings is provided to identify the future opportunities of blockchain-based supply chains, including prospects for tertiary industries and concerted efforts that are necessary to explore sustainability themes. This article provides valuable information to help scholars and practitioners better determine the relevant research topics to accelerate the development of blockchain-based supply chains.}

In LPWANs, especially in LoRa, security is a major concern due to the resource constraints of the devices, the sensitivity level of the transmitted data, the large amount of connected devices, among other reasons. This paper studies the key management mechanism of LoRaWAN environments. A secure architecture for key management based on smart contracts and permissioned blockchain to enhance security and availability in LoRaWAN networks is proposed. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed blockchain-based LoRaWAN architecture, a working prototype has been created using open-source tools and commodity hardware. Performance analysis shows that the prototype presents similar execution time and latency values, when compared to a traditional system, especially for small and medium-sized LoRaWAN networks. We also discuss why the proposed solution can be used in environments with a large number of end-devices.},

abstract="To stay competitive in marketplace, companies have to design compelling products that are successfully adopted by their intended users. To achieve this goal, companies must establish and validate a shared understanding of their customer base. In this paper we propose a persona development process for creating value in an organization. This process, which can be conducted relatively quickly and cost-effectively, provides a roadmap for continual assessment of organizational understanding of customer base. It creates value for companies by allowing them (1) to build consensus internally around their customers' needs, goals, and preferences, and (2) to validate/test the accuracy of the assumptions they make about their customers. We tested this process in a fortune 500 company. Our results suggest that our process is both effective and efficient in establishing a shared understanding of the customer base and in testing the accuracy of assumptions made by organizations about their customers.",

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to indicate the variables that are responsible for the success of project management. The variables were classified into groups of four driver management skills, critical success factors, monitoring and control and lessons learned according to PMI methodology - Project Management Institute. The variables were selected for the following statistical analysis: the Correspondence Analysis selected the most important variables to manage projects, and the set of variables was evaluated by 28 project managers, who, through a questionnaire (survey) validated the most important and those that apply to most medium and large companies. Additionally statistical analysis - Analytical Hierarchy (AHP) and the joint analysis - were applied to rank the variables according to their importance. The results were obtained 18 variables of group management skills, 19 critical success factors, 13 monitoring and control, and 7 related lessons learned. The critical factors revealed in this research converged with the investigated theory, pointing basic and vital factors for a successful project management. The research pointed to each group director the 6 relevant variables that need to be managed so that the management of the projects to be successful. Therefore, several factors influence the performance of a design, however, some factors may be related to the possibility of success.},

    abstract = { Given that user involvement is important in system design, this study addresses the as yet unexplored question of how a user should be involved in the system design process. Two radically different processes of interaction between a systems designer and a manager were compared in an information system design exercise. In one interaction process, the designer conducted a traditional interview of the manager. He asked questions, analyzed data and made suggestions. In the alternative interaction process, there was an initial sharing of information and mutual suggestions, followed by a critique of each other's suggestions. The study found that for this ill-structured problem: The alternative interaction process produced higher quality designs with important implementation advantages. The two interaction processes produced designs which used different types of organization control strategies. These results may be due to a problem finding contingency—different processes of interaction may help to define different problems, and thereby produce different, but equally rational, solutions. For the management of organization design, the process of interacting with users has important implications for the quality of the resulting design, the type of organization control strategy employed, and the subsequent implementation of the system. }
