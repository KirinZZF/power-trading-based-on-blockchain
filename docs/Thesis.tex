\begin{abstract}
% 气候与能源问题近些年越发严重，因此许多措施被提出和实施以缓解气候变暖和能源枯竭，其中大力清洁可再生能源发电以及对企业进行碳排放限制是最卓有成效的两个方法，同时因此而衍生的清洁电力交易以及碳排放交易所各有各的状况，清洁能源交易因为收益低廉而鲜为人知，碳排放交易为了方便管理只准许企业参与且与其他领域关联不多。随着区块链技术的普及，一切事物变得可追溯，且历史记录难以篡改，因此碳排放交易有了跟清洁电力交易挂钩并向公众开放的可能。本项目通过区块链技术搭建了一个基于区块链的清洁电力交易系统，旨在实现一个能够在清洁电力被购买的同时自动颁发清洁电力证书，以及清洁电力证书的所兑换的清洁电力积分可以换取礼物以及相互交易的系统。
Climate and energy issues have become increasingly serious in recent years, therefore numerous measures have been proposed and implemented to mitigate warming and energy depletion, among which the promotion of clean power generated by renewable energy and carbon emission restrictions on enterprises are two of the most effective methods, but the derivation of clean power trading and carbon emissions trading have their own status, clean power trading is little known because of the low revenue, and carbon emissions trading is only allowed for enterprises to participate in order to facilitate regulation and has little connection with other areas. With the popularity of blockchain technology, everything become traceable and the history is hard to be tampered with, so it is possible for carbon emissions trading to be linked with clean power trading and open to the public. This project builds a blockchaired clean power trading system through blockchain technology, aiming to realize a system that can automatically issue clean power certificates when clean power is purchased, and the clean power points redeemed from clean power certificates can be exchanged for gifts and traded with others.

% 我要感谢我的Supervisor Dr.Nawfal Fadhel,他对我非常有耐心，每周都会与我开一次例会来讨论上周的工作以及下周的任务，并且对我的论文提出了许多的指导性意见，教我通过Git管理我自己的项目并帮助我决定了我的论文结构和格式，让我摆脱迷茫。另外他时常鼓励我，为我加油，让我十分有干劲。
\acknowledgements{I would like to thank my Supervisor Dr. Nawfal Fadhel, who was very patient with me, had weekly meetings with me to discuss the work of the previous week and the tasks for the next week, and gave me a lot of guidance on my thesis, taught me to manage my own project through Git and helped me decide on the structure and format of my thesis to get me out of my confusion. He also encouraged me and cheered me on from time to time, which kept me very motivated.}
